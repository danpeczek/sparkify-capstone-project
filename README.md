# sparkify-capstone-project
My last project for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. Project will be about finding churns for music streaming application. I'm going to use a Spark for this task.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The notebook requires a 'data' directory where the sparkify dataset is saved. The dataset is available for a students of [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) program in a Capstone project.

If you open the notebook as it is, you should be able to see my latest results.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This repository is my Capstone project for [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)  program. In this project I'm going to apply Spark technology to find churn users based on the events in Music Streaming service like Spotify.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Repository contains one jupyter notebook that presents steps done by me in the analysis. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the process of individual steps.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The findings can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@danpeczek/how-to-predict-when-our-users-are-going-to-churn-8e6756ecc22e).
